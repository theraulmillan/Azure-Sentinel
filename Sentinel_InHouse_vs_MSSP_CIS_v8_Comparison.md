# Microsoft Sentinel – In-house SOC vs MSSP
## CIS Critical Security Controls v8 Aligned Comparison

This document provides a side-by-side comparison between an internal SOC operating Microsoft Sentinel
and an MSSP-managed Sentinel model. The comparison is aligned to CIS Critical Security Controls v8,
with emphasis on detection ownership, response capability, and audit readiness.

## Side-by-Side Comparison Table

| Area | In-house Sentinel SOC | MSSP-managed Sentinel | CIS v8 Mapping |
|-----|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Detection ownership | Full ownership of analytics rules and KQL. Immediate changes. | Rules abstracted or owned by MSSP. Changes require tickets. | CIS 8.5, 8.6 |
| Use-case depth | Custom detections tied to business risk and environment. | Generic detections reused across customers. | CIS 8.7 |
| Alert context | Full Defender, Entra ID, and workload context preserved. | Context normalized or summarized. | CIS 8.2 |
| Tuning speed | Rapid tuning of noisy alerts. | Delayed tuning due to process overhead. | CIS 8.8 |
| Response latency | Near-real-time via automation rules. | Dependent on MSSP SLAs and escalation paths. | CIS 17.1, 17.3 |
| SOAR control | Full control of playbook logic and execution. | Playbooks restricted or approval-gated. | CIS 17.2 |
| Cost control | Direct ownership of ingestion and query optimization. | Limited transparency into cost drivers. | CIS 2.1, 2.3 |
| Log visibility | Full access to raw logs and KQL queries. | Filtered or limited log visibility. | CIS 8.1 |
| Threat hunting | Proactive hunting driven by internal hypotheses. | Often out of scope or extra cost. | CIS 8.4 |
| Compliance evidence | Raw logs, timelines, and queries available. | Summary reports with limited depth. | CIS 8.1, 17.6 |
| Skill development | Internal Sentinel and KQL expertise grows. | Skills retained by MSSP. | CIS 14.2 |
| Vendor dependency | Low. Customer controls detections and response. | High. Offboarding risk exists. | CIS 15.1 |
| Coverage model | Dependent on internal staffing and shifts. | 24x7 coverage by default. | CIS 17.5 |

## Control-Level Observations

### CIS Control 8 – Audit Log Management

- Internal SOC retains raw telemetry and investigation depth.
- MSSP models often prioritize normalization over fidelity.

---

### CIS Control 17 – Incident Response

- Internal SOC can automate containment and response.
- MSSP response often escalates rather than contains.

Risk question  
Who is authorized to take immediate response actions?

A-LIGN retains the responsability to run all incident response actions around detections. MSSP is limited to alerting.

---

### CIS Control 14 – Security Skills and Training

- In-house operation builds long-term Sentinel capability.
- MSSP reliance leads to internal skill erosion.

Risk question  
Can your team operate Sentinel if the MSSP exits?

Yes, this would only require additional resources to cover extended hours, but all the tooling is in place.

---

## Where MSSPs Add Value

- Continuous monitoring without hiring.
- Initial alert triage and noise reduction. Alert enrchiment is non-existant today, alerts generated by the MSSP are a copy of the alerts generated by Sentinel, based on the analytics rules deployed by the MSSP. There is no evidence that other in-house develop analytic rules are monitored or used in any way.
- Suitable for small or low-maturity teams.

---

## Where In-house Sentinel Dominates

- Full control over detections and automation.
- Strong correlation across Microsoft signals and coordination 
- Faster response and stronger audit posture, specially with Attack Disruption enabled.

---

## Common Hybrid Operating Model

- MSSP handles L1 monitoring and validation.
- Internal SOC owns detections, automation, and incidents.
- Compliance evidence and cost control remain internal.

This model preserves CIS Controls 8 and 17 while maintaining coverage.
